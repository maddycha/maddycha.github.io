                    <br>
                    Plant Pals is a task management application that utilizes a virtual pet to help promote work and life balance. The application aims to improve user behavior through suggesting breaks to be completed after each task, while providing the user with a new plant pal each month as an extrinsic motivator.

                    I participated in user testing, low- and mid-fi prototypes, and visual style, which a focus on the general interactivity of the application.

            <h4 class="subheader">Literature Review</h4>
            <p class="projecttext">We started off the process by looking at a few different studies and papers with similar material to what we were considering including in our application.



            </p>
<ul class="projectlist"><li><a href="http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=0&sid=ed4f0b32-e456-4fec-bcda-db146be173db%40sdc-v-sessmgr05&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=2015-29703-009&db=psyh" target="_blank">plenty of virtual pets encouraging healthy habits (eating fruits and veggies, exercising)</a></li><li><a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2001-01021-003?doi=1" target="_blank">breaks should include non-work and low-stress activities</a></li><li><a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-psych-010213-115137" target="_blank">day-to-day positive feedback loop via reflection on goals acts as a self-affirmation intervention</a></li></ul>


            <div class="separator"></div>




            <h4 class="subheader">Initial User Research</h4>
            <p class="projecttext">To further our understanding of the space, we sent out a survey asking people about their task tracking habits in terms of whether or not they use an outside resource, what they find important in terms of features, and how effective they find their current method. These were the main insights we found from our survey:</p>

<ul class="projectlist"><li>people who utilize applications for task management purposes </li><li>many people were unsatisfied with their current task management applications, but could not find a substitute</li><li>most users took quite frequent unintentional breaks, especially in relation to social media</li><li>people who did plan breaks had them dependent on completing major goals/checkpoints</li></ul>

            <div class="separator"></div>




            <h4 class="subheader">Paper Prototyping</h4>
            <p class="projecttext">After our initial research, we decided we had enough information to start creating some paper prototypes that would allow us to user test as well as visualize our idea.</p>

            <div class="separator"></div>




            <h4 class="subheader">Low-Fi Prototyping</h4>
            <p class="projecttext">After getting basic feedback from a few of our peers, we worked on integrated all of the aspects of our task adding features more hammered down to test more concretely. We worked on low-fi screens for the plant, the to-do list, as well as the garden area of the application.</p>

            <h4 class="subheader">Website Iterations</h4>
            <p class="projecttext">We started to code out the website with a focus on the monster generation section, as it made up most of the interactive portion of the site. We experimented with different visual styles and animations to make the experience more engaging for the user, while not being too overwhelming.</p>

            <div class="separator"></div>




            <h4 class="subheader">Generated Monsters</h4>
            <p class="projecttext"></p>

            <div class="gallery7"><img src="imgs/aiga-m1.png"><img src="imgs/aiga-m2.png"><img src="imgs/aiga-m3.png"><img src="imgs/aiga-m4.png"><img src="imgs/aiga-m5.png"><img src="imgs/aiga-m6.png"><img src="imgs/aiga-m7.png"><img src="imgs/aiga-m8.png"><img src="imgs/aiga-m9.png"><img src="imgs/aiga-m10.png"><img src="imgs/aiga-m11.png"><img src="imgs/aiga-m12.png"><img src="imgs/aiga-m13.png"><img src="imgs/aiga-m14.png"></div>
            <div class="separator"></div>




            <h4 class="subheader">Print Piece</h4>
            <p class="projecttext">Using our website, we were able to generate a couple of monsters to create postcards of. These would essentially go hand-in-hand with the website, and the users would be able to keep their printed monster as a type of souvenir. </p>
            <div class="gallery4"><img src="imgs/aiga-cards1.png"><img src="imgs/aiga-cards2.png"><img src="imgs/aiga-cards3.png"><img src="imgs/aiga-cards4.png"></div>

            <div class="separator"></div>




            <h4 class="subheader">Reflection</h4>
            <p class="projecttext">As this was my first time going through such an extensive amount of information, I was able to learn quite a bit not only about analyzing data, but learning what is important to myself as a designer. It was really eye-opening to see how many different individuals there are, while comforting to know that there were those who shared similar demographics and interests with me.</p>
