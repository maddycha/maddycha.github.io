                                    Over the summer, I worked with the Twitter and Periscope design teams to redesign the profile section of the Periscope application to further improve health on the platform. I collaborated closely with engineers, designers, and researchers to finalize content, visuals, and interaction for profiles on Periscope as well as on Twitter Live. 
                                    <br><br>

                                    I worked as the main designer on the project in collaboration with my project manager, design mentor, and front-end and back-end engineers to visualize and prototype the designs for M1 release.

                        <p class="projecttext">The main purpose of the redesign was to help broadcasters make informed decisions when accepting/declining guests to their streams by allowing users to better represent themselves through their profile. Another goal of the project was to begin thinking about the unification between the Twitter and Periscope design languages.</p>

                        <p class="projecttext">I started off by looking at profile pages from different applications—from other broadcasting apps to social media and podcasting apps. To avoid being distracted by visual elements, I decided to use colors to represent different types of information and block out visual design elements.</p>

                        <p class="projecttext">As I began to incorporate some of these elements into sketches and wireframes, I was able to get a better sense of the complexities of the problem space. I worked on trying to see how much information I could begin to fit on the profile, with an interest in providing more valuable information at first glance. Some ideas I worked with were ranking pages, visible comments, and social proof information.

                            I also began working on unifying the visual and interactive elements of the Periscope profile with Twitter design standards.</p>

                            I worked with two main profile examples (long and short bios/names) as well as profiles in different languages to test for edge cases.</p>

For scoping purposes, I worked on perfecting the visuals and constraints of the information that would show up on the condensed profile and how it would translate when the sheet was expanded.</p>

Rather than use these to highlight what was missing, I decided to give the illustrations a more positive light that would hopefully work to encourage users to create content themselves.</p>
