                    Over the summer, I worked with the Twitter and Periscope design teams to redesign the profile section of the Periscope application to further improve health on the platform. I collaborated closely with engineers, designers, and researchers to finalize content, visuals, and interaction for profiles on Periscope as well as on Twitter Live.

                    <br>
                    I worked as the main designer on the project in collaboration with my project manager, design mentor, and front-end and back-end engineers to visualize and prototype the designs for M1 release.

            <h4 class="subheader">Initial Designs</h4>
            <p class="projecttext">What immediately stood out to me when looking at the profile pages in app was the lack of immediate information. Additionally, it was hard for me to tell that the recent/followers/following statistics were clickable.</p>
            <img class="fullwidthimg" src="imgs/twitter/Desktop%20HD%20Copy%203.png">
            <div class="separator"></div>

            <h4 class="subheader">Goals</h4>
            <p class="projecttext">The main purpose of the redesign was to help broadcasters make informed decisions when accepting/declining guests to their streams by allowing users to better represent themselves through their profile. Another goal of the project was to begin thinking about the unification between the Twitter and Periscope design languages.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>


            <h4 class="subheader">Competitive Analysis</h4>
            <p class="projecttext">I started off by looking at profile pages from different applicationsâ€”from other broadcasting apps to social media and podcasting apps. To avoid being distracted by visual elements, I decided to use colors to represent different types of information and block out visual design elements.</p>
            <img class="fullwidthimg" src="imgs/twitter/competitiveanalysis.png">
            <div class="separator"></div>


            <h4 class="subheader">Initial Wireframes</h4>
            <p class="projecttext">As I began to incorporate some of these elements into sketches and wireframes, I was able to get a better sense of the complexities of the problem space. I worked on trying to see how much information I could begin to fit on the profile, with an interest in providing more valuable information at first glance. Some ideas I worked with were ranking pages, visible comments, and social proof information.
                <br><br>
                I also began working on unifying the visual and interactive elements of the Periscope profile with Twitter design standards.</p>

            <div class="separator"></div>

            <h4 class="subheader">Mid-fi Iterations</h4>
            <p class="projecttext">I began to populate my wireframes with real information to get a better sense of how the design would look like in app. At this point, I was trying to test utilizing a condensed profile view so that broadcasters viewing audience profiles would be reminded that they are still broadcasting and would spend less time scrolling through people's profiles.<br><br>
                I worked with two main profile examples (long and short bios/names) as well as profiles in different languages to test for edge cases.</p>

            <div class="separator"></div>

            <h4 class="subheader">Finalizing Design</h4>  
            <p class="projecttext">As I continued with my explorations, I worked with the team to prioritize different elements of my designs for the milestone one release. For scoping purposes, I worked on perfecting the visuals and constraints of the information that would show up on the condensed profile and how it would translate when the sheet was expanded.</p>
            <img class="fullwidthimg" src="imgs/twitter/finalizingcontent.png">
            <div class="separator"></div>          

            <h4 class="subheader">Prototyping</h4>
            <p class="projecttext">Once I was comfortable with where the content &amp; design was headed, I started prototyping to communicate some of the more complex interactions to my team. I utilized Origami Prototype to build out the profile and share with engineers.</p>

            <div class="separator"></div>

            <h4 class="subheader">Empty State Illustrations</h4>
            <p class="projecttext">As many Periscope users currently lack public broadcasts, I worked on creating empty state illustrations that would help make newer profiles a bit friendlier. Rather than use these to highlight what was missing, I decided to give the illustrations a more positive light that would hopefully work to encourage users to create content themselves.</p>

            <div class="separator"></div>  

            <h4 class="subheader">Twitter LIVE Considerations</h4>
            <p class="projecttext">Currently, there is a lack of distinction between viewing Periscope or Twitter profiles through the Twitter LIVE context. I worked on using copy to add distintion between the two views as well as a way to switch between the two profiles.</p>

            <div class="separator"></div>

            <h4 class="subheader">Reflection</h4>
            <p class="projecttext">In working with people of so many different backgrounds and roles, I learned how to better communicate my design ideas and concepts. Additionally, being in such a fast-paced environment allowed me to work on my iteration and prototyping skills, while not sacrificing visual integrity of a design. With so much to cover in just one summer, this project helped me in prioritizing tasks and considering scope.</p>
