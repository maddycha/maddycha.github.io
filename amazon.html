                                        Despite being the world's largest online retailer, Amazon struggles with information hierarchy and visual identity. This is incredibly apparent in the design of its home page.

                                        For this project, I focused on improving the experience for frequent users of Amazon Prime with the goal of creating larger basket sizes per prime customer and increasing product subscriptions for Amazon. I had seven days to complete this project.

At this stage, I was mostly interested in understanding their motivations for using Amazon Prime, their shopping habits within the website, and how they come across new products.

This helped me better understand the problem space and develop goals for myself for the project. I wanted to make sure to help alleviate some of the pain points within the home page to motivate people to spend time on it, rather than only relying on the search functionality. This would ideally help to increase basket size, as users would be browsing (and ideally purchasing) more items than intended.</p>

                                    I created a very simple design guideline for myself as I went through the redesign. As one of the issues I found through my research was that the current design was incredibly overwhelming, I stuck to very simple typography. I also tried to stick very closely to the current visual style of Amazon (aside from their commissioned font, which I substituted with Neue Haas Unica for the purpose of this case study).</p>

                                <p class="projecttext">With the feedback I received, I began to design out high-fidelity screens to better visualize my concept. I decided to design the screens to be easy to interact with, and ordered components in a way that would increase visual variability. I made sure to include real content to make the whole experience seem more concrete.</p>

From here, I refined the interactions I had in mind and made suree that each interaction seemed intuitive enough. I tried to keep the motions consistent within different interactions.</p>

If I had more time, I would have loved to conduct more user research, and possibly prototype out pages that would compliment the home page. Additionally, I would love to design out each of the potential components so that it would be easier to hypothetically implement the system.</p>
